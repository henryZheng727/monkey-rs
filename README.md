This is my implementation of the Monkey language, as described in the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go]("https://interpreterbook.com") by Thorsten Ball. I chose to implement it in Rust as a learning exercise for myself.

# Usage
Clone the repository, `cd` into it, and use `cargo run` like normal.

# Extra Features
So far, I have not added any extra features.
